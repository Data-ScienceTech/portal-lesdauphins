## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### SQL Error: "relation already exists"
**Solution**: This is OK! It means some tables are already there. The script will skip them and continue.

### SQL Error: "duplicate key value"
**Solution**: This is OK! It means the data is already inserted.

### Login doesn't work
**Check**:
1. Did you create the user in Authentication → Users?
2. Email must be exactly: `test@lesdauphins.ca`
3. Did the SQL script run successfully?

### Dashboard is blank
**Check**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for error messages
3. Verify the user exists in `public.users` table
