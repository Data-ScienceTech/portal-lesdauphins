## 📝 Notes for Windsurf/AI Assistant

### Code Style Preferences
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use async/await over promises
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Always include loading states
- Use optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- Follow React best practices
- Use shadcn/ui components consistently

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., OwnerDashboard)
- Functions: camelCase (e.g., fetchOwnerData)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_FILE_SIZE)

- Database tables: snake_case (e.g., service_requests)

### File Organization
- One component per file
- Co-locate related files
- Separate business logic from UI
